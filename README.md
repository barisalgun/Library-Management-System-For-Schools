 Library Management System For Schools<br>
 ## Introduction:
The Library Management System for Schools is a desktop application that streamlines the process of managing school libraries. With this application, librarians can<br> easily store and view information about books, magazines, and other library materials, as well as track the circulation of these items.<br>

## Key Features:
Catalog Management: Store and view information about books, magazines, and other library materials.<br>
Circulation Management: Track the removal, return, and renewal of library materials and record borrowing history.<br>
Reporting: Generate reports on the usage of library materials and provide visually understandable information to librarians.<br>

## Technologies Used:
Backend: Java<br>
Frontend: Java Swing<br>
Database: Mysql<br><br>

## Usage:

Since I had a problem uploading the database to github, the project may not work exactly as you want on your computer.<br>
But in general, you can run the application from the login class to run the project.<br>
Use the catalog management feature to store and view information about library materials.<br>
Remember that you must first register as a librarian to take action. Then you can register as a student by giving the student the registration number.<br>
Use the circulation management feature to track the removal, return, and renewal of library materials.<br>
When you register with the student, it is sufficient to write only a certain part of the name of the book you want,example ->(to kill a mockingbird) ->(mock) is sufficient.<br>
You can access transactions related to students and book borrowing when you log in as a librarian.<br>
Use the reporting feature to generate reports on the usage of library materials.<br>
